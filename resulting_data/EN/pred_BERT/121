the driver and vehicle licensing agency ( dvla ) is scrapping the paper counterpart that accompanies all uk plastic photocard licences
information about penalty points for traffic violations will be held on the dvla 's database , and will have to be checked online , by phone or by post
motoring groups fear the switch to a fully online system will make it more difficult for car hire firms which want to check a motorist 's details
