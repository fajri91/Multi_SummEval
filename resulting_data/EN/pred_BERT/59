acting ceo maura pally defended the foundation 's work and reaffirmed its commitment to transparency
she said the foundation expected to refile some of its tax forms , following a voluntary external review , because it had ` mistakenly combined ' government grants and donations
said the total revenue was reported accurately and that grants were properly broken out on its website
however , the tempered apology came the same day that the charity seemed like a ` slush fund ' for one of america 's most powerful political families
