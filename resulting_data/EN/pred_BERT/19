the thief scaled a two-storey antique market before breaking into a rooftop vent and squeezing down a narrow shaft to reach the store
he picked three sets of locks and crawled on the floor ` like a snake ' to avoid triggering infrared security beams
the eight-minute raid took place at the vintage watch store in hampstead , north london , on saturday at about 9pm
the man and an accomplice returned the following night to try a similar break-in but were disturbed and fled empty-handed after neighbours heard them trying to smash through the reinforced vent
they left behind ladders , a screwdriver and a balaclava , which are being analysed by police
