lawmakers in colorado and washington are considering spelling out what 's allowed when it comes to making the concentrated marijuana at home
in colorado , at least 30 people were injured in 32 butane explosions involving hash oil last year
washington 's legal marijuana law in 2012 did not permit the production of hash or even edibles at home ; it technically remains a felony even to use weed purchased at a state-licensed store to make brownies
