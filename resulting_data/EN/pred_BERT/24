david billing , 48 , was diagnosed with mouth cancer in october 2013
he had to have part of his tongue removed and underwent 14 hours of surgery
surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of tongue
the lost tissue was replaced with muscle from mr billing 's arm
the only drawback is that it still has hairs on it , and he now has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved
