tomas berdych set up a hotly-anticipated rematch with andy murray with a straight-sets win against juan monaco in the miami open quarter-finals .
eighth seed berdych defeated argentine monaco 6-3 , 6-4 to ensure a first meeting with muray since their tense and at times acrimonious australian open semi-final which murray won in four sets .
monaco , backed by a large argentine support , put up a strong fight in the second set until berdych broke for a 5-4 lead .
