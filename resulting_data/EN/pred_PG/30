jane bacon , 51 , booked the ' final trip ' to sharm el sheikh with her husband peter , 52 , after being told she could die within months from breast cancer .
she has now hit out at easyjet after apparently being told that its ' terminally ill policy ' only considers full refunds and not changes to bookings .
easyjet has since apologised and refunded the charges .
